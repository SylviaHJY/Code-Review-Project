https://review.opendev.org/71694,NSX: synchronous and asynchronous handlers for security groups,"NSX: synchronous and asynchronous handlers for security groups This patch introduces asynchronous handling of security group operations in the NSX backend. Asynchronous tasks are managed via celery, which is added as a requirement. Asynchronous operations can be enabled by setting to True the enable_async_tasks flag. Asynchronous tasks are conceived to synchronize Neutron state with NSX state, rather than simply applying Neutron API operations. Therefore the asynchronous task, when invoked, will also proceed to re-create objects which were removed in the NSX backend. By default operations are still handled in a synchronous fashion. This patch refactors the plugin in a way that once the DB operation is completed, the call is dispatched to a 'handler' function, which could be either synchronous or asynchronous. This patch therefore also provides a beneficial separation of the database transactions from NSX operation. The patch also adds code for handling failures in NSX operations in order to guarantee that the Nuetron DB consistently represents the actual NSX state.

Asynchronous tasks are conceived to synchronize Neutron state with NSX state, rather than simply applying Neutron API operations. Therefore the asynchronous task, when invoked, will also proceed to re-create objects which were removed in the NSX backend. By default operations are still handled in a synchronous fashion. This patch refactors the plugin in a way that once the DB operation is completed, the call is dispatched to a 'handler' function, which could be either synchronous or asynchronous. This patch therefore also provides a beneficial separation of the database transactions from NSX operation. The patch also adds code for handling failures in NSX operations in order to guarantee that the Nuetron DB consistently represents the actual NSX state.

https://review.opendev.org/558533,Do not abort ata secure erase if security is in enabled state,"Do not abort ata secure erase if drive security is in enabled state At least in the case of INTEL SSDSC2BX016T4R drives, a ' hdparm --security-unlock' command does not remove the enabled line of the security section of `hdparm -I`. As a consequence, the GenericHardwareManager does not perform an ata secure erase (it relies on this line to be set to `not enabled`). For an INTEL SSDSC2BX016T4R, it has been manually verfied that the following sequence of steps perform a secure erase sucessfully: - hdparm --user-master u --security-unlock /dev/sda - hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass NULL /dev/sda - hdparm --user-master u --security-erase-enhanced NULL /dev/sda this is indicated by the ""not enabled"" line appearing in the output of `hdparm -I /dev/sda`. It is therefore proposed that we do not actually care if the `enabled` line appears in the output pre-erase. We should only verify that is set to ""not enabled"" after an erase is attempted. When we do not check the enabled line, the test test_erase_block_device_ata_security_enabled becomes redundant with test_erase_block_device_ata_security_enabled_unlock_exception taking its place. As the tests are very dependent on the order of calls to `utils.execute`, I added some asserts to the failure cases to ensure that the correct call was failing.

Previously, UpdateMembersStep does not support help_text_template option. To use a bold tag in the added help message, we need to use a template instead of help_text, so _workflow_step_update_members.html is updated.

https://review.opendev.org/508657,Add attach/detach security group action to neutron driver,"Add attach/detach security group action to neutron driver To modify the security groups attached to the list through congress policy, actions to attach/detach a security group to/from port is needed. Because the neutron v2 API and client do not support attach/detach of a single security group, but only the replacement of the entire security group list, we add these custom actions which combine a read and update action to accomplish the attach/detach.

https://review.opendev.org/461092,Use the security context of the playbook when checking out roles,"Use the security context of the playbook when checking out roles When the executor checks out and runs content, the security context (trusted or untrusted) comes in to play in two ways: whether speculative merging should be used when checking out the content and the level of access to ansible. This is straightforward for playbooks: when running an untrusted playbook, use the speculatively merged repo and the untrusted ansible environment. When running a trusted playbook, only use the branch tip of the playbook's repo, and the trusted ansible environment. When we consider roles, we also need to consider whether to use the speculatively merged role repo, or the branch tip. The current code uses the security context of the role repo to decide which to do (untrusted role repo uses the speculatively merged repo, trusted role repo uses branch tip). However this presents a problem. Consider a job defined in a trusted repo which uses a role defined in an untrusted repo. The playbook will be run in the trusted execution context, but the role it depends on will come from the speculatively-merged role repo. This means a user could propose a change which Depends-On a change to the role repo and cause mischief. The author of the job in the trusted repo should be able to rely on the fact that when that job runs, both the playbook and the roles used by that playbook only contain code that is actually in the respective repositories. Likewise, should a job in an untrusted repo inherit from that job, when its playbook runs, it should be able to use a speculative change to the role repo. In short, when we are running a trusted playbook, we should use the branch tip of all role repos used by that playbook. And when we run an untrusted playbook, we should use any speculatively merged changes to those roles. Since we can run both kinds of playbooks in a single job, this change prepares roles in both manners, if necessary. If any playbook run by the job is untrusted, we will prepare the speculatively-merged repo as a role. If any playbook is trusted (or the role does not appear in the dependency chain for the change), we prepare the branch tip of the role repo. When we run the playbooks, we use the appropriate version of each role based on the security context of the playbook. Change-Id: I06dd3851a8f805dba9afe1b4a0eaa1b2fdd4efa2",1,James E.

However, there is no authentication or encryption done at all on these connections, so anyone that has access through the firewall can connect to these sessions and also possibly have access to the unencrypted data sent across. Support was recently added to pypowervm for optionally specifying an x509 certificate/key that will be used for x509/TLS security authentication between the client and the VNC Repeater to allow for authentication and encrypted transmission. The VNC Repeater will continue to communicate with the LinuxVNC session locally without authentication or encryption. If a x509 certificate/key is specified, the VNC Repeater will enforce that the client negotiates to use VeNCrypt as part of the security handshake and then will wrapper the socket to use TLS 1.2 for secure communication.

If it is instantiated a warning message is reported to the end-user to notify them that security requirements of the application were ignored.

https://review.opendev.org/294243,Disable Neutron port security driver on upgrades,"Disable Neutron port security driver on upgrades When upgrading from Kilo to Liberty, networks existing prior to the upgrade prevented new VMs from booting. This was due to the introduction of the port_security extension to Neutron's defaults in the openstack-ansible Liberty release.

Greenfield Liberty environments do not experience this behavior, as the port_security driver is enabled for all networks created there.

https://review.opendev.org/229122,Use random IPs in security service tests,"Use random IPs in security service tests This patch changes the creation of security services in Manila tempest to use randomized IP addresses instead of name-like strings for both the 'dns_ip' and 'server' fields. The use of a name-like string for the dns_ip field does not make sense from a positive test perspective. The server field is more ambiguous in whether it should take an IP or a hostname, but since nearly anything that can take a hostname can also accept an IP, but not necessarily the reverse (e.g. the NetApp drivers are expecting an IP), then it makes more sense to use an IP here as well to cater to a broader audience. The rand_ip() method is not in an ideal location. My preference would be to push for this method to make it into the tempest_lib.common.utils.data_utils package along with all the other rand_whatever() methods. However, until that can be submitted, accepted, and released, it will need to live inside the manila tests temporarily.

https://review.opendev.org/726046,Fix security issues with EC2 credentials,"Fix security issues with EC2 credentials This change addresses several issues in the creation and use of EC2/S3 credentials with keystone tokens. 1. Disable altering credential owner attributes or metadata Without this patch, an authenticated user can create an EC2 credential for themself for a project they have a role on, then update the credential to target a user and project completely unrelated to them. In the worst case, this could be the admin user and a project the admin user has a role assignment on. A token granted for an altered credential like this would allow the user to masquerade as the victim user. This patch ensures that when updating a credential, the new form of the credential is one the acting user has access to: if the system admin user is changing the credential, the new user ID or project ID could be anything, but regular users may only change the credential to be one that they still own. Relatedly, when a user uses an application credential or a trust to create an EC2 credential, keystone automatically adds the trust ID or application credential ID as metadata in the EC2 access blob so that it knows how the token can be scoped when it is used. Without this patch, a user who has created a credential in this way can update the access blob to remove or alter this metadata and escalate their privileges to be fully authorized for the trustor's, application credential creator's, or OAuth1 access token authorizor's privileges on the project. This patch fixes the issue by simply disallowing updates to keystone-controlled metadata in the credential. 2. Respect token roles when creating EC2 credentials Without this patch, a trustee, an application credential user, or an OAuth1 access token holder could create an EC2 credential or an application credential using any roles the trustor, application credential creator, or access token authorizor had on the project, regardless of whether the creator had delegated only a limited subset of roles. This was because the trust_id attribute of the EC2 access blob was ignored, and no metadata for the application credential or access token was recorded either. This change ensures that the access delegation resource is recorded in the metadata of the EC2 credential when created and passed to the token provider when used for authentication so that the token provider can look up the correct roles for the request.

https://review.opendev.org/174588,Add security groups events,"Add security groups events Today ML2 mech drivers have no direct exposure of security groups, and they can only infer them from the associated network/ports. This is problematic as agentless ML2 mech drivers have no way to intercept securitygroups events and propagate the information to backend, or more generally, react to them.

https://review.opendev.org/54007,Allow all printable ASCII characters in security group names,"Allow all printable ASCII characters in security group names. Thus far, the security group name was checked with Django's validate_slug. Consequently, some characters like spaces (bug #1224576) and @ (bug #1233501) were forbidden. This fix removes validate_slug and provides a less restrictive validation. Now, all printable ASCII characters -- i.e. from 0x20 to 0x7E -- are valid. Note that diacritics are disallowed.

https://review.opendev.org/144538,Ensure subnet for port security group tests,"Ensure subnet for port security group tests This change simply adds a subnet to the networks in tests verifying creation or update of a port without a security group. This is being done because there are slight differences across neutron plugins logic for managing association between ports and security groups. For instance, the VMware NSX plugin which also implements the ""port security"" extension, requires an IP address on a port in order to associate it with the default security group. Adding a subnet to the network used in the test ensures the test exercises a use case which is common to all plugins. This patch simply adds the subnet to the network without changing the remaining logic of the modified tests.

https://review.opendev.org/726435,Fix security issues with EC2 credentials,"Fix security issues with EC2 credentials This change addresses several issues in the creation and use of EC2/S3 credentials with keystone tokens. 1. Disable altering credential owner attributes or metadata Without this patch, an authenticated user can create an EC2 credential for themself for a project they have a role on, then update the credential to target a user and project completely unrelated to them. In the worst case, this could be the admin user and a project the admin user has a role assignment on. A token granted for an altered credential like this would allow the user to masquerade as the victim user. This patch ensures that when updating a credential, the new form of the credential is one the acting user has access to: if the system admin user is changing the credential, the new user ID or project ID could be anything, but regular users may only change the credential to be one that they still own. Relatedly, when a user uses an application credential or a trust to create an EC2 credential, keystone automatically adds the trust ID or application credential ID as metadata in the EC2 access blob so that it knows how the token can be scoped when it is used. Without this patch, a user who has created a credential in this way can update the access blob to remove or alter this metadata and escalate their privileges to be fully authorized for the trustor's, application credential creator's, or OAuth1 access token authorizor's privileges on the project. This patch fixes the issue by simply disallowing updates to keystone-controlled metadata in the credential. 2. Respect token roles when creating EC2 credentials Without this patch, a trustee, an application credential user, or an OAuth1 access token holder could create an EC2 credential or an application credential using any roles the trustor, application credential creator, or access token authorizor had on the project, regardless of whether the creator had delegated only a limited subset of roles. This was because the trust_id attribute of the EC2 access blob was ignored, and no metadata for the application credential or access token was recorded either. This change ensures that the access delegation resource is recorded in the metadata of the EC2 credential when created and passed to the token provider when used for authentication so that the token provider can look up the correct roles for the request.

https://review.opendev.org/725895,Fix security issues with EC2 credentials,"Fix security issues with EC2 credentials This change addresses several issues in the creation and use of EC2/S3 credentials with keystone tokens. 1. Disable altering credential owner attributes or metadata Without this patch, an authenticated user can create an EC2 credential for themself for a project they have a role on, then update the credential to target a user and project completely unrelated to them. In the worst case, this could be the admin user and a project the admin user has a role assignment on. A token granted for an altered credential like this would allow the user to masquerade as the victim user. This patch ensures that when updating a credential, the new form of the credential is one the acting user has access to: if the system admin user is changing the credential, the new user ID or project ID could be anything, but regular users may only change the credential to be one that they still own. Relatedly, when a user uses an application credential or a trust to create an EC2 credential, keystone automatically adds the trust ID or application credential ID as metadata in the EC2 access blob so that it knows how the token can be scoped when it is used. Without this patch, a user who has created a credential in this way can update the access blob to remove or alter this metadata and escalate their privileges to be fully authorized for the trustor's, application credential creator's, or OAuth1 access token authorizor's privileges on the project. This patch fixes the issue by simply disallowing updates to keystone-controlled metadata in the credential. 2. Respect token roles when creating EC2 credentials Without this patch, a trustee, an application credential user, or an OAuth1 access token holder could create an EC2 credential or an application credential using any roles the trustor, application credential creator, or access token authorizor had on the project, regardless of whether the creator had delegated only a limited subset of roles. This was because the trust_id attribute of the EC2 access blob was ignored, and no metadata for the application credential or access token was recorded either. This change ensures that the access delegation resource is recorded in the metadata of the EC2 credential when created and passed to the token provider when used for authentication so that the token provider can look up the correct roles for the request.

https://review.opendev.org/725893,Fix security issues with EC2 credentials,"Fix security issues with EC2 credentials This change addresses several issues in the creation and use of EC2/S3 credentials with keystone tokens. 1. Disable altering credential owner attributes or metadata Without this patch, an authenticated user can create an EC2 credential for themself for a project they have a role on, then update the credential to target a user and project completely unrelated to them. In the worst case, this could be the admin user and a project the admin user has a role assignment on. A token granted for an altered credential like this would allow the user to masquerade as the victim user. This patch ensures that when updating a credential, the new form of the credential is one the acting user has access to: if the system admin user is changing the credential, the new user ID or project ID could be anything, but regular users may only change the credential to be one that they still own. Relatedly, when a user uses an application credential or a trust to create an EC2 credential, keystone automatically adds the trust ID or application credential ID as metadata in the EC2 access blob so that it knows how the token can be scoped when it is used. Without this patch, a user who has created a credential in this way can update the access blob to remove or alter this metadata and escalate their privileges to be fully authorized for the trustor's, application credential creator's, or OAuth1 access token authorizor's privileges on the project. This patch fixes the issue by simply disallowing updates to keystone-controlled metadata in the credential. 2. Respect token roles when creating EC2 credentials Without this patch, a trustee, an application credential user, or an OAuth1 access token holder could create an EC2 credential or an application credential using any roles the trustor, application credential creator, or access token authorizor had on the project, regardless of whether the creator had delegated only a limited subset of roles. This was because the trust_id attribute of the EC2 access blob was ignored, and no metadata for the application credential or access token was recorded either. This change ensures that the access delegation resource is recorded in the metadata of the EC2 credential when created and passed to the token provider when used for authentication so that the token provider can look up the correct roles for the request.

https://review.opendev.org/725891,Fix security issues with EC2 credentials,"Fix security issues with EC2 credentials This change addresses several issues in the creation and use of EC2/S3 credentials with keystone tokens. 1. Disable altering credential owner attributes or metadata Without this patch, an authenticated user can create an EC2 credential for themself for a project they have a role on, then update the credential to target a user and project completely unrelated to them. In the worst case, this could be the admin user and a project the admin user has a role assignment on. A token granted for an altered credential like this would allow the user to masquerade as the victim user. This patch ensures that when updating a credential, the new form of the credential is one the acting user has access to: if the system admin user is changing the credential, the new user ID or project ID could be anything, but regular users may only change the credential to be one that they still own. Relatedly, when a user uses an application credential or a trust to create an EC2 credential, keystone automatically adds the trust ID or application credential ID as metadata in the EC2 access blob so that it knows how the token can be scoped when it is used. Without this patch, a user who has created a credential in this way can update the access blob to remove or alter this metadata and escalate their privileges to be fully authorized for the trustor's, application credential creator's, or OAuth1 access token authorizor's privileges on the project. This patch fixes the issue by simply disallowing updates to keystone-controlled metadata in the credential. 2. Respect token roles when creating EC2 credentials Without this patch, a trustee, an application credential user, or an OAuth1 access token holder could create an EC2 credential or an application credential using any roles the trustor, application credential creator, or access token authorizor had on the project, regardless of whether the creator had delegated only a limited subset of roles. This was because the trust_id attribute of the EC2 access blob was ignored, and no metadata for the application credential or access token was recorded either. This change ensures that the access delegation resource is recorded in the metadata of the EC2 credential when created and passed to the token provider when used for authentication so that the token provider can look up the correct roles for the request.

https://review.opendev.org/725888,Fix security issues with EC2 credentials,"Fix security issues with EC2 credentials This change addresses several issues in the creation and use of EC2/S3 credentials with keystone tokens. 1. Disable altering credential owner attributes or metadata Without this patch, an authenticated user can create an EC2 credential for themself for a project they have a role on, then update the credential to target a user and project completely unrelated to them. In the worst case, this could be the admin user and a project the admin user has a role assignment on. A token granted for an altered credential like this would allow the user to masquerade as the victim user. This patch ensures that when updating a credential, the new form of the credential is one the acting user has access to: if the system admin user is changing the credential, the new user ID or project ID could be anything, but regular users may only change the credential to be one that they still own. Relatedly, when a user uses an application credential or a trust to create an EC2 credential, keystone automatically adds the trust ID or application credential ID as metadata in the EC2 access blob so that it knows how the token can be scoped when it is used. Without this patch, a user who has created a credential in this way can update the access blob to remove or alter this metadata and escalate their privileges to be fully authorized for the trustor's, application credential creator's, or OAuth1 access token authorizor's privileges on the project. This patch fixes the issue by simply disallowing updates to keystone-controlled metadata in the credential. 2. Respect token roles when creating EC2 credentials Without this patch, a trustee, an application credential user, or an OAuth1 access token holder could create an EC2 credential or an application credential using any roles the trustor, application credential creator, or access token authorizor had on the project, regardless of whether the creator had delegated only a limited subset of roles.

When these rules are removed the vm is no longer able to send traffic out. This patch adds these rules for NVP. One thing to note in the patch is that now a bunk rule of IPv4 127.0.0.1/32 is added to each security profile. The reason for this is by default NVP security profiles allow all egress traffic until a rule is added and then it just lets traffic matching those rules out.

https://review.opendev.org/4154,Don't allow EC2 removal of security group in use.,"Don't allow EC2 removal of security group in use. Fix bug 817872. This patch modifies the behavior of removing security groups via the EC2 API to better match the EC2 API spec. The EC2 documentation says that a group that is still in use can not be removed. A new function has been added to the db API to find out whether a particular security group is still in use.

https://review.opendev.org/692907,Remove redundant call to get/create default security group,"Remove redundant call to get/create default security group In the instance_create DB API method, it ensures the (legacy) default security group gets created for the specified project_id if it does not already exist. If the security group does not exist, it is created in a separate transaction. Later in the instance_create method, it reads the default security group back that it wrote earlier (via the same ensure default security group code). But since it was written in a separate transaction, the current transaction will not be able to see it and will get back 0 rows. So, it creates a duplicate default security group record if project_id=NULL (which it will be, if running nova-manage db online_data_migrations, which uses an anonymous RequestContext with project_id=NULL). This succeeds despite the unique constraint on project_id because in MySQL, unique constraints are only enforced on non-NULL values [1]. To avoid creation of a duplicate default security group for project_id=NULL, we can use the default security group object that was returned from the first security_group_ensure_default call earlier in instance_create method and remove the second, redundant call. This also breaks out the security groups setup code from a nested method as it was causing confusion during code review and is not being used for any particular purpose. Inspection of the original commit where it was added in 2012 [2] did not contain any comments about the nested method and it appeared to either be a way to organize the code or a way to reuse the 'models' module name as a local variable name.

https://review.opendev.org/691403,Remove redundant call to get/create default security group,"Remove redundant call to get/create default security group In the instance_create DB API method, it ensures the (legacy) default security group gets created for the specified project_id if it does not already exist. If the security group does not exist, it is created in a separate transaction. Later in the instance_create method, it reads the default security group back that it wrote earlier (via the same ensure default security group code). But since it was written in a separate transaction, the current transaction will not be able to see it and will get back 0 rows. So, it creates a duplicate default security group record if project_id=NULL (which it will be, if running nova-manage db online_data_migrations, which uses an anonymous RequestContext with project_id=NULL). This succeeds despite the unique constraint on project_id because in MySQL, unique constraints are only enforced on non-NULL values [1]. To avoid creation of a duplicate default security group for project_id=NULL, we can use the default security group object that was returned from the first security_group_ensure_default call earlier in instance_create method and remove the second, redundant call. This also breaks out the security groups setup code from a nested method as it was causing confusion during code review and is not being used for any particular purpose. Inspection of the original commit where it was added in 2012 [2] did not contain any comments about the nested method and it appeared to either be a way to organize the code or a way to reuse the 'models' module name as a local variable name.
